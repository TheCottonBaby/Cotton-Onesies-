Natural Fiber: Cotton is a soft, natural fiber that's gentle on a baby's delicate skin. It doesn't irritate or rash the way some synthetic fabrics can. Moisture-Wicking: Cotton absorbs moisture and sweat, keeping the baby's skin dry and reducing the risk of heat rash or discomfort. Shop from here: The Cotton Baby
